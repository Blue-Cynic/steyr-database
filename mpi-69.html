            <h3>Development History</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Work on the weapon began in the 1960s as Steyr sought out to make a cheap SMG for price conscious customers. They would take inspiration and design cues from another successful SMG at the time, the Uzi. The weapon's shape, its stamped steel design, and ergonomics were all influenced by that SMG. The weapon is unique for it has a progressive trigger, something the AUG would inherit. This trigger meant the gun can be semi-automatic with light trigger pulls and then would become fully automatic if the trigger is held down. Much like most SMGs at the time, it was direct blowback. It was a system that relied purely on the fired cartridge's energy to move the gun's bolt backwards. It was cheap and simple and was the operating system of most SMGs in the 20th century.</p>
                <p>The gun had a relatively lukewarm reception due to having very few military contracts, especially in Steyr's homeland, Austria. Much of the blame for its commercial performance revolved around two influential SMGs that released first at the time, the Uzi and the MP5. The Uzi came first, having been around since the 1950s. "Why bother a new untested SMG when one can simply get a combat proven Uzi?" was a general thought amongst prospecting customers. The Heckler and Koch MP5 released first over the MPi 69 as well. But it stood out, the weapon looked advanced, of which it was. Rather than using a direct blowback system like most SMGs, it uses a roller delayed blowback system. This meant that rollers were present in the gun and are tasked as being a means to slow down the gun's bolt as it moves backwards to eject a casing and extract a new cartridge from the magazine. This system proved beneficial for the MP5 was very light recoiling despite having a rate of fire of 800 RPM.</p>
                <p>Steyr would roll out the MPi 81, an improved version of the SMG, but it too had limited success. Steyr blames it partly for the AUG which the Austrian military adopted in 1977. The gun simply took its attention away. Then there was the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege which was publicly broadcasted, showing British SAS operators armed with MP5s breaching the embassy. This televised counter-terrorrist operation would become a huge marketing boost for the MP5 as many countries began ordering, leaving MPi 81 in the dust for it released a year later. What truly killed off the SMG's chances of commercial success were Steyr's introduction of the AUG Para, an SMG variant of the AUG and the introduction of the Steyr TMP, an evolution of this old SMG. The Austrians really liked them over the MPi 69 and 81 and so did other nations.</p>
