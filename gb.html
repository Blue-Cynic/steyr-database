            <h3>Development History</h3>
            <article>
                <p>By the late 1960s, Steyr decided to look into a unique gas-delayed blowback system called the Barnitzke locking system. This was first used by the Volksturmgewehr 1-5, a German last ditch weapon from World War II. They decided to implement this system into a pistol. This system directs some of the gas towards a piston whose job is to act as a resistance to the bolt that is coming towards the back in order to eject and cycle a new round. This ensures improved reliability as it reduces pressure from higher pressure ammunition and reduces the recoil for the momentum of the bolt that is coming back is lower, due to being slowed. The bolt moves back slower than the standard direct blowback system which has no form of resistance whatsoever, leading to higher recoil. It comes at the cost of being more complex however.</p>
                <p>Steyr designed this pistol with the goal of replacing the old WW2 era Walther P38 and Browning Hi-Power which were used by the Austrian military and police. Steyr used its connections with the Austrian military to collect input and get an idea of what the soldiers want for a new pistol. The weapon was originally named as the Pi 18, Pi for "pistole" in German and 18 for its 18 round capacity, which was plentiful for its time. They would ditch the name in favor of the GB, meaning GasBresme. So, they had a pistol that shoots 9x19mm, the new standard pistol caliber for NATO. The weapon has a unique operating system that makes it less recoiling compared to its contemporaries. And most of all, it has an 18 round capacity, rare for its time and makes it a so-called "Wonder Nine", pistols that shoot 9x19mm and were relatively high capacity. The Wonder Nine would become the new standard for pistols from then on.</p>
                <p>When introducing the gun and negotiating for contracts for the Austrian military, the military authorities seemed interested with the gun. But then Steyr decided to push the pistol alongside a stock for it and an SMG they have been working on as well, the MPi 69. The military decided to drop out of the negotiations, leaving Steyr discouraged to put the weapon into the civilian market and disappointed at the military's decision.<p>
                <p>For some time, Steyr went on to add improvements to the design in order to meet the newer standards laid out in the 80s. The original didn't have a safety nor a slide release to which Steyr decided to introduce in their newer versions. Now, the Austrian military finally decided to start trials to find a new service pistol to replace their aging Walter P38s. From an outside perspective, it seemed like Steyr was going to win. They had a handgun that had years of improvements behind it, alongside its operating system that made it lighter recoiling amongst its peers. Unfortunately, it would lose to a handgun from a company that at the time, was known for making shovels, knives, and curtain rods. The company was Glock and the gun was the legendary Glock 17.</p>
                <p>The Austrian military chose the Glock 17 over the GB for a myriad of reasons. The biggest of which were: the gun was relatively simple with very few moving parts, it was rather lightweight thanks to its polymer construction, and it was a lot cheaper to manufacture than the GB thanks to said simplicity and its polymer construction as opposed to metal. The GB was ultimately sidelined by everyone as it would lose constantly to other pistols, such as the Beretta 92 in the American pistol contracts and the SIG P226 in other European pistol contracts. Its only known contracts were for law enforcement in Lebanon and Pakistan. Steyr would cease its production by November 1988 with only around 15,000 - 20,000 pistols made. Its life would be a repeat for their assault rifle after the AUG, the STM-556.</p>
