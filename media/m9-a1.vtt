00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:14.640
You can read spec sheets all day long, but
when it comes time to choose a pistol,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.460
nothing matters if it doesn't feel right.
And if you want a polymer frame pistol

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.240
with superb ergonomics, absolute safety,
and extraordinary precision,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.540
the Steyr family of A1 pistols can't be
beat.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160
The A1 is available in a range of grip
sizes and barrel lengths,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.620
but unifying them all is Steyr's
insistence on making this feel better in

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.780
your hand than any other pistol out there.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.100
But the design isn't all about comfort.
Steyr's pistols virtually eliminate the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.980
muzzle rise found in most pistols,
allowing you to come back on target

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.720
quicker when precious seconds count. The
Steyr line also utilizes a sighting

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.680
system that's unique among all
manufacturers. Instead of traditional

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.860
three-dot sights, the trapezoidal sights
on the Steyer come into line extremely

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.200
quickly, forming a triangle that alerts
you to the precise moment you're back on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.500
target.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.240
Choosing the right pistol is about finding
the gun that feels like an extension of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.660
you, responding exactly when and how you
expect it to.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.540
And when it comes to superior ergonomics,
safety, and precision,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.720
nothing beats a Steyr. Steyr. Count on
it.
