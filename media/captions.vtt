You can read spec sheets all
day long, but when it comes

1
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.289
time to choose a pistol,
nothing matters if it

2
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.319
doesn't feel right.

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.508
And if you want a polymer
frame pistol with superb

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.928
ergonomics, absolute safety,
and extraordinary precision,

5
00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.899

pistols can't be beat.

6
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.909

other pistol out there.

10
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.659
But the design isn't
all about comfort.

11
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.808
Steyr's pistols virtually
eliminate the muzzle rise

12
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.608
found in most pistols,
allowing you to come back

13
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.579
on target quicker when
precious seconds count.

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.939
The Steyr line also utilizes-
